## Overview
In this project, I will create a model that can predict if a hotel review is negative or positive so that hotels can use it to classify their reviews correctly. I will analyze a specific hotel in London and compare it to other hotels in the same city. We will walk through multiple Natural Language Processing to understand how we can use machines to read reviews and get insights from them. Baseline models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Ensemble models include Voting, Bagging, GridSearch, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The final model was a GridSearch SVM with an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-Score 0.8247.

This project walks through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, data preprocessing, vanilla model, an ensemble model iterations. You can find a summary of the project in the final notebook.
